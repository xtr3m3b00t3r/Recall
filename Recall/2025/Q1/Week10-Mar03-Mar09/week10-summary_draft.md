## ðŸ’Ž Key Learnings & Insights

- -
- -
- -
- -
- - Unitron schedules work like this. The blocks live in the UC32 devices, the schedules live in the UC32.Net devices. The schedule programs need to be downloaded to work. Just a strategy download won't work.
- - Leeds is the man for ms/tp. He read the pcap from Chiswick Park like a BOSS.
