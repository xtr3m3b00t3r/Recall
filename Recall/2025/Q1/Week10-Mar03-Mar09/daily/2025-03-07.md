# Daily Notes: 2025-03-07

## 🏗️ Projects Worked On

- IO Controls - Chiswick Park
- Ringwood - Ipswitch Football Club

## 🛠️ Tasks Completed

- Worked with Leeds to compile a report as to why ms/tp devices aren't working into FBXi. Likely device misconfigration
- Worked with Ringwood to fix schedules incoming from Unitron devices. Required Unitron download, and there was a wrong address. 

## 🤔 Decisions Made

- Need to create and send out LinkedIn posts for BuildingPro off the back of Serge's YouTube videos. 

## 💡 Ideas & Insights

- We need to come up with a way to transition CBT12 devices. There is no path, we could lose thousands, and many buildings will move away from us. 

## 🧠 Learnings

- Unitron schedules work like this. The blocks live in the UC32 devices, the schedules live in the UC32.Net devices. The schedule programs need to be downloaded to work. Just a strategy download won't work. 
- Leeds is the man for ms/tp. He read the pcap from Chiswick Park like a BOSS.

## 🚧 Blockers & Challenges

- Matt needs to gather his passion and focus on positive outcomes. He complains a lot, but has really good insights in the business and customers. 

## 📌 Follow-ups Needed

- Follow up with Nick regarding the MS/TP issue
- Follow up with the LInkedIn posts for BuildingPro

## 📝 Notes for Weekly Summary

- As always, the information lives in peoples heads.
